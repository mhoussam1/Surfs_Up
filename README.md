# Surfs_Up


## Overview of Project
# Background: 

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. 


The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and one for December.



## Analysis and Challenges

### 	Results:

- December

In December we can see that there is a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0



- June

In June we can see that there is a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0


As for the Standard Deviation we can see that in December shows 3.75 and in June shows a 3.25, showing the difference of 0.5. 



## Summary:


From the data that was collected and the summary for each of the 2 months we can know the temperatures for each of the months. But this is not showing the different things in the weather such as humidity and rain, things that could affect the weather and how it feels. This means that we can run different queries to help know and determine better results to help with knowing to open the shop or not. The more data results we have the more we can tell and have a better detailed report.
